# match-the-pics-game
C++ finished code of a picture matching game, played on the cmd, does not use any graphic libraries or STL data structures or algorithms . 
This is meant to be the final assignement for the MIT open course ware course "introduction to C++" course number : 6.096, though it doesn't satisfy the STL requirement. 
This is a beginner level project, for learning purposes

All ASCII art is from ASCII art archive https://www.asciiart.eu/ . 

Files included are 'main.cpp' containing the main code, 'attic.h' containing library inlusions and functions' and class' defiitions, 'animals.dat' and 'unknowns.dat' containing the ascii art used fashioned into cards, check it out, 'picture matching game.rar' contains the compiled game with static linked libraries, so it should work on windows, I hope.
